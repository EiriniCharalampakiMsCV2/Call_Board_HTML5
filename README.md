# Call_Board_HTML5
The purpose of this project is to make a program where users of a site will be able to create and pin their messages in a call board. The board should be with cork material and the pins to be the typical plastic pins. Users should be able to pin their messages in any place they prefer inside the board. We are going to use HTML5 and JavaScript to implement the application.
